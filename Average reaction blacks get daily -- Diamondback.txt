<b><head>Average reaction blacks get daily</head></b>
<p>How dare you black students of the
University complain?</p>
<p>I think it's perfectly asinine of<space></space>you
people to think you can get something
for nothing. Furthermore, I think
you've been given enough already.</p>
<p>After all, there isn<add>'</add>t a white student
union on campus <add>--</add> neither would it
have been permitted.</p>
<p>Look at all the money SGA appro<add>-</add>
priated you just because you<add>'</add>re black.
Let<add>'</add>s face it. You niggers get all the
breaks. When there's an opening in
the dining halls or the janitorial
staff, who gets the job? A nigger.</p>
<p>Look at the riots. You niggers
damned near robbed my brother-in<add>-</add>
law blind. Now he can<add>'</add>t even get
the insurance company to pay off.
Violence isn<add>'</add>t the answer especially
when it<add>'</add> communist inspired.</p>
<p>What if we whites had armed our<add>-</add>
selves and looted black businesses?
You claim that the black student
population isn<add>'</add>t representative of
black population on a whole.</p>
<p>Can we help it if niggers don<add>'</add>t want
to come here? Besides, nobody had
to tell me to come here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you have to accept
the fact that the black students aren<add>'</add>t
as intelligent as whites and therefore
won't do as well in college.</p>
<p>You think you have it bad. Look at
the Jews, the Irish, the Italians. They
made it, didn<add>'</add>t they? Why can<add>'</add>t you
people stop making bad scenes?</p>
<p>Don<add>'</add>t your leaders have any con<add>-</add>
trol over you savages? The display
of violence in the SGA budget hearing
was simply disgraceful. You say you
don<add>'</add>t want tokenism but you were
willing to accept only two black mem<add>-</add>
bers on the cheer leading squad.</p>
<p>Why not the whole squad? You also
showed extreme lack of respect for
our great President Elkins. Hasn<add>'</add>t
he established an effective enough
line of communication between you
and his administration?</p>
<p>If not, why don<add>'</add>t you tell him so?
There<add>'</add>s a proper way to get results
at the University.</p>
<p>I close my comments by saying you
<!-- Nearby print smudge does not impede text recognition of "you" -->
should take a good look at yourselves
and realize that good hard work and a
good education is all you need to get
ahead.</p>

<p>This is a letter which is full of the
racism that confronts black students

<p>The person who wrote this letter
is considered armed, dangerous and
an enemy to America. He can be found
in any age group, in any establish<add>-</add>

<p>W<del>l</del><add>h</add>i<del>i</del>tey, it is your duty to seek him
out and destroy him, before we do!</p>
