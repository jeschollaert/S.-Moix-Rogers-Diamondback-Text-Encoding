         <div type="editorial"><p>How dare you <desc>black</desc>students of the
<orgName>University</orgName> complain?</p>
<p>I think it's perfectly asinine of<space/>you
people to think you can get something
for nothing. Furthermore, I think
you've been given enough already.</p>
<p>After all, there isn<add>'</add>t a <desc>white</desc> student
union on campus <add>--</add> neither would it
have been permitted.</p>
<p>Look at all the money <orgName><abbr>SGA</abbr></orgName> appro<lb break="yes"/>
priated you just because you<add>'</add>re <affiliation>black</affiliation>.
Let<add>'</add>s face it. You niggers get all the
breaks. When there's an opening in
the dining halls or the janitorial
staff, who gets the job? A nigger.</p>
<p>Look at the riots. You niggers
damned near robbed my brother-in<lb break="yes"/>
law blind. Now he can<add>'</add>t even get
the insurance company to pay off.
Violence isn<add>'</add>t the answer especially
when it<add>'</add> <affiliation>communist</affiliation> inspired.</p>
<p>What if we <affiliation>whites</affiliation> had armed our<lb break="yes"/>
selves and looted <desc>black</desc> businesses?
You claim that the <affiliation>black student
population</affiliation> isn<add>'</add>t representative of
<affiliation>black population</affiliation> on a whole.</p>
<p>Can we help it if niggers don<add>'</add>t want
to come here? Besides, nobody had
to tell me to come here.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you have to accept
the fact that the <affiliation>black students</affiliation> aren<add>'</add>t
as intelligent as <affiliation>whites</affiliation> and therefore
won't do as well in college.</p>
<p>You think you have it bad. Look at
the Jews, the Irish, the Italians. They
made it, didn<add>'</add>t they? Why can<add>'</add>t you
people stop making bad scenes?</p>
<p>Don<add>'</add>t your leaders have any con<lb break="yes"/>
trol over you savages? The display
of violence in the <orgName><abbr>SGA</abbr></orgName> budget hearing
was simply disgraceful. You say you
don<add>'</add>t want tokenism but you were
willing to accept only <num>two</num> <affiliation>black mem<lb break="yes"/>
bers on the cheer leading squad</affiliation>.</p>
<p>Why not the whole squad? You also
showed extreme lack of respect for
our great <name>President Elkins</name>. Hasn<add>'</add>t
he established an effective enough
line of communication between you
and his administration?</p>
<p>If not, why don<add>'</add>t you tell him so?
There<add>'</add>s a proper way to get results
at the <orgName>University</orgName>.</p>
<p>I close my comments by saying <damage>you</damage>
